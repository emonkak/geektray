## Installations

You can download the binary for Linux/amd64 from the [release page](https://github.com/emonkak/geektray/releases).

## Known Bugs

### *A title is blank for Wine's application tray icons*

The tray icon window created by Wine isn't set a title. Additionally, The process that created window is not the application itself, but exeplorer.exe. So we can't get any information for the tray icon.

There is the [patch](https://github.com/emonkak/config/blob/master/gentoo/etc/portage/patches/app-emulation/wine-vanilla/systray-icon-title.patch) for Wine to work-around this issue.

## FAQ

### *Is it supports freedesktop.org's StatusNotifierItem?*

No, because there are few applications using StatusNotifierItem at this time.
